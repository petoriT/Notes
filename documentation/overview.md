## How to document a Module

To describe an application module so that other developers can know how to use it and debug it, you should provide the following information:

1.  A clear and detailed explanation of the module's functionality and how it fits into the overall application.
2.  A list of any external dependencies the module has and how to install them.
3.  A guide on how to use the module, including any input and output parameters and their data types.
4.  Examples of how the module can be used in code.
5.  Any known bugs or limitations of the module, along with a description of how to reproduce them and any workarounds.
6.  A documentation on testing and debugging methods
7.  Lastly, it is also important to keep the documentation up-to-date as the module evolves over time.

## Module documentation template

Here is a template you can use to document an application module:

**Introduction**

- **Provide a brief overview of the module's purpose and functionality.**

> "The User Authentication module is responsible for handling user registration, login, and logout functionality for the application. It provides a secure and efficient way to authenticate users by utilizing industry-standard encryption methods and storing user information in a database. The module allows users to register with a unique email and password, and then use those credentials to log in and access protected areas of the application. It also includes a 'forgot password' feature that allows users to reset their password in case they forget it."

- **Explain how the module fits into the overall application and any external dependencies it has.**

> "The User Authentication module is a crucial component of the overall application, as it enables users to access protected areas and interact with the application's features. It is integrated with the application's database, allowing it to store and retrieve user information securely. It is also integrated with the application's routing system, so that users are redirected to the appropriate pages depending on their authentication status.

**A flowchart can be a helpful tool for illustrating the functionality of a module, here's an example of a flowchart for a user authentication module**:

                           +---------------+
                           | User opens    |
                           | application   |
                           +-------+-------+
                                   |
                                   |
                           +-------v-------+
                           | Check if user |
                           | is logged in  |
                           +-------+-------+

                                   |
                           +-------v-------+

                                   | No
                                   |
                           +-------v-------+
                           | Show login    |
                           | form          |

                           | Validate      |
                           | credentials   |
                           +-------+-------+
                                   |
                                   | Valid
                                   |

                           | protected     |
                           | pages         |
                           +-------+-------+

                                   |

                           | Show error    |
                           | message       |
                           +-------+-------+

This flowchart provides a visual representation of the authentication process and how it interacts with other parts of the application. It starts with the user opening the application, then it checks if the user is logged in or not, if yes it redirects the user to the protected pages, otherwise, it shows the login form, then it checks the user's credentials, if they are valid it redirects the user to the protected pages, otherwise it shows an error message.
